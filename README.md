## ‚ùì Why ComfyMark?
macOS already has built-in screenshots, and there are paid tools like CleanShot X ‚Äî  
so why make another one?

- I dont like Paywalls (I respect it) but still, if I need something fast theres nothing fast out there
- üñ•Ô∏è **Built for developers** ‚Äî made in Swift, easy to extend or hack on.
- üé® **Future-focused** ‚Äî planned GPU/Metal acceleration for real-time editing.
- ü§¶ **The breaking point** ‚Äî I downloaded a free app from the App Store, and it hit me with a paywall just to edit a screenshot. That was it. Time to build my own.
