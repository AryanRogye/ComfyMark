## ❓ Why ComfyMark?
macOS already has built-in screenshots, and there are paid tools like CleanShot X —  
so why make another one?

- I dont like Paywalls (I respect it) but still, if I need something fast theres nothing fast out there
- 🖥️ **Built for developers** — made in Swift, easy to extend or hack on.
- 🎨 **Future-focused** — planned GPU/Metal acceleration for real-time editing.
- 🤦 **The breaking point** — I downloaded a free app from the App Store, and it hit me with a paywall just to edit a screenshot. That was it. Time to build my own.
